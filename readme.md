# My first game with JS
## Eat 4x fruits and look at the time in your console.log() 

> _"Hands on learning is the key to success"_

* Move with your keyboard: WASD-key
* It tracks the time until you capture the snake
* The console.log displays the total time when one capture 4x fruits ( one can still continue to capture more fruits )
* It tracks every point
* It places a random fruit and it can not be on same position as the snake
* The snake can't move outside the box
* The first fruit changes position if one does not capture it in less then 5sec
